### Code Requirements
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 
You need to install opencv library


### Description

The goal here is fair self-explanatory:

1) Detect the presence of a colored ball using computer vision techniques.
2) Track the ball as it moves around in the video frames, drawing its previous positions as it moves.


OpenCV comes with a trainer as well as detector.
